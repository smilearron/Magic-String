# Magic-String
A method that takes in a list of strings to get median length of all strings and magic output strings.
For each string:
1. It will be reversed if its length is a multiple of 4.
2. It will be truncated to 5 characters if its length is a multiple of 5.
3. It will be converted to all uppercase if it contains at least 3 uppercase characters in the first 5 characters.
4. If the string ends with a hyphen, it will be removed and will be appended the next string in the list.
5. Print the median length of all strings.

Once you run the code, you can see the hint in the console like "Enter strings: ". Then you can input the string one by one. 
Once you finish input, you can type "finish" to get the magic output strings.
